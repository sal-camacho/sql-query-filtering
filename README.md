# Structured Query Language Portfolio

This repository showcases my SQL query development and database analysis work completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. Each file documents hands-on tasks using the MariaDB shell to filter, join, and interpret login and employee data in support of security investigations. These activities demonstrate a methodical approach to extracting insights from relational data using structured filtering, logical operators, and table joins.

## About This Repository

As a security analyst in training, I used SQL to investigate login anomalies, manage employee system data, and validate activity across multiple tables. My work reflects foundational database skills used in real-world incident analysis â€” from filtering log data to tracing machine assignments.

Each walkthrough aligns with core cybersecurity operations and supports goals from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

This repo features:

- Filtering records using comparison and logical operators  
- Combining data across tables using INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT JOIN  
- Querying date and time-based login attempts  
- Applying pattern matching with `LIKE` and exclusion logic using `NOT`
